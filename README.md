This is a work in progress; the aim is to develop an implementation for formal concept analysis which can be extended to the results from my current research on introducing non-monotonicity to FCA.

### Currently Working On

- Parser for JSON objects representing formal contexts
- Concept Generating
- Querying Implications
- Introducing partial order and accompanying non-monotonic semantics for rational consequence
- Generating Typical Concepts

### Distant Future

- Visualising concept lattices
- Entailment
